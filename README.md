RivenMonch is a program designed to emulate the RNG in Riven for the purposes of manipulating and exploiting the game, using a weakness in how the version of ScummVM packaged by default with it is seeded.
It's built using WinForms for C# and is designed to be used as a standalone EXE, so as to be as flexible as possible for Windows users.
